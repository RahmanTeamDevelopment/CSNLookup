INSTALLATION BEFORE DEPLOYING THE APPLICATION TO THE SERVER
===========================================================

Step 1)
Run ./install.sh in the main folder

Step 2)
Add absolute paths pointing to the reference genome fasta files in the config.txt file.
Both GRCh37= and GRCh38= should be set.
The corresponding index (.fai) files must also be in the same directories where the fasta files are located.

Step 3)
Add some transcript databases to transdbs/ folder:
For example, in order to add Ensembl 70 and 84, run:
python cava/ensembl_prep.py -e 70 -o transdbs/ensembl_70
python cava/ensembl_prep.py -e 84 -o transdbs/ensembl_84

Installation is ready, the application will automatically recognize and import the transcript databases.
